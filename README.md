Easy to use bitcoin icons for both React and Vue projects. the icons were originally designed by the bitcoin design community, [bitcoin icons](https://bitcoinicons.com/).

For react `npm install @bitcoinuikit/reacticons`
For vue `npm install @bitcoinuikit/vueicons`

And you just have to import it and use the components :)
